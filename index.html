	<p>Hello, my name is Susan and I'm a media technology student at KTH in Stockholm, Sweden. I am currently on my 5th and final year of studies...</br></br>
	During my time at KTH I've mainly taken courses in interaction design and web development, where we have mostly worked with HTML, CSS and JavaScript but also PHP, XML, Python and a lot of prototyping.</p></div>
